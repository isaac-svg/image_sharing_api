Node.js API with Backend Pagination, Image Upload, Authentication, and Protected Routes

This is a comprehensive Node.js API template that provides essential features for building a robust backend application. It includes support for backend pagination, image upload, authentication, and protected routes, allowing you to quickly develop secure and scalable APIs.

Features:

- Backend Pagination: Implement efficient pagination techniques to retrieve large datasets in smaller chunks, improving performance and reducing bandwidth usage.
- Image Upload: Enable users to upload images or files to the server, validating and storing them securely. This feature is useful for various applications like social media platforms, e-commerce systems, platforms.
- Authentication: Implement user authentication using a JWT (JSON Web Token) based strategy. Users can register, log in, and obtain a token that grants access to protected routes.
- Protected Routes: Restrict access to certain API endpoints by implementing middleware that checks for valid authentication tokens. This ensures that sensitive or private data can only be accessed by authorized users.

Technologies and Libraries Used:

- `Node.js`: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server.
- `Express.js`: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js, used to create the API endpoints and handle HTTP requests.
- `MongoDB`: A popular NoSQL database used for storing and retrieving data. It provides flexibility and scalability for handling various data models.
- `Mongoose`: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, simplifying database interactions and providing schema validation. -` bcrypt`: A library for hashing passwords, ensuring secure storage and authentication.
- `jsonwebtoken`: A library for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication.
- `dotenv`: A module for loading environment variables from a .env file, allowing secure configuration of sensitive information.

### Installation and Usage:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/isaac-svg/image_sharing+_app_api.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure environment variables: Create a .env file with required configurations (e.g., database URL, JWT secret, etc.).
4. Start the server: `npm run dev`
5. Test the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or cURL.
